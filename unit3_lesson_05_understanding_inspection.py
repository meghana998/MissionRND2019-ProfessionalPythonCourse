Here you do not use any tools at all. The idea is to rely on the failure inputs and outputs and just use paper and pen
and work through the failing code by hand to figure out the mistake.

Basically you run the code line by line in your mind and/or paper and try to figure out the bug.

This might seem to be tedious, but this is very important as you will develop the habit of debugging code while you write
it and the quality of your code will be much better.

Majority of companies make you write code on paper/board in your face 2 face interviews, so if you lack this skill, you
will not make it.

You can identify the failing test from the pytest output. Then mentally walk through the code execution using that
input and see what could have gone wrong.
