Fill up each of these methods so that it does what it is intended to do. Use
only the standard data types we have seen so far and builtin functions.

Idea is for you to refer to online documentation and get your work done.

All of these functions require use of the builtin functions documented at
http://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html

Your job is to see which ones apply and invoke them. Most of the methods require
writing 1 or 2 lines of code.

Do not use any control flow statements (if, for...) in this assignment.
Assume that inputs are valid and of expected type, so no checking required.

I repeat, No control statements please even if you already know python!

Notes:

1. This assignment will encourage top-down declarative thinking in you. You are all familiar with bottoms-up thinking,
   this is another important habit to develop. You need both.

2. This will help you to think in terms of problem decomposition into smaller problems that are usually
   done for you by python or you solve the smaller problems further till you reach sub-problems that python does for you.

3. Read the input constraints carefully, I purposely constrained inputs for this assignment.

4. If you think a particular builtin will be useful, play with it in the console and see how it works.

5. Reading material:
    http://latentflip.com/imperative-vs-declarative (read once before and after doing the exercises).
