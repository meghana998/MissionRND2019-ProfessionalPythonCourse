 While this does seem like a joke, it WORKS very well in practice :). The ACT OF DESCRIBING your problem out ALOUD
 verbally or in WRITING often clarifies your thinking and takes you to the solution.

 I recommend you to work with a friend on this. DESCRIBE YOUR THINKING PROCESS OUT ALOUD to see this
 in action.
