The best advice I can give you to save time on debugging is to keep your code simple and readable than clever
and convoluted. This is an acquired skill and you must strive to make your code as easy and obvious to
the reader as possible. 

For e.g. do not write code like this in your real projects.

Heed this warning :)

Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as
possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it.
- Brian Kernighan

That said, it takes time to develop the skill of writing well structured, readable code. And usually you work in a team
and code is written by many people of varying skill.

So debugging/troubleshooting is the most important topic that any new programmer should be proficient in.
For the first few years of your career, it is not unusual to SPEND MOST OF YOUR TIME trying to fix some bug in your own
code or more frequently in existing teams code. So a well developed debugging mindset and knowledge of available tools
will help you go a long way.

This is a very vast topic and many books have been written on the subject! For the sake of this course, we will confine
ourselves to the tools and techniques mentioned in the lessons.

Each lesson introduces one idea/tool for debugging.
- using visualizer - executing in a visualizer
- rubber duck debugging - describe your problem to a friend or a toy duck
- print debugging - debugging by adding a few print statements and observing the output
- using debugger - executing in a debugger
- inspection - debugging in your mind

Your goal is to get familiar with all of them instead of just 1 or 2 of these methods.
